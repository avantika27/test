Chemistry is that physical science which includes the study of a range of matters such as atoms, crystals, molecules and many other collections of matters whether they are in isolation or in combination. It also involves the concepts of energy and entropy that are related to the spontaneity of various chemical processes. Since this is a branch of natural sciences, it is commonly known as “The Science of Matter”.

Professionals working in this field are called chemists. They study the various compositions of matters and its concerned properties like density, size, shape and acidity. Usually the chemists specialize in one or more sub disciplines depending on their interests and the choice of their specialized field.

Due to highly prized nature of Chemistry and its diverse curriculum, it lays the foundation for extremely productive and exciting career in variety of disciplines as pharmaceutical, agrochemical, mineralogy, molecular biology, biotechnology, nanotechnology, polymer technology, teaching research, scientific publication and so on. The importance of Chemistry would not diminish over time, so it will remain a promising career path. In a nut shell, the study of Chemistry provides a vehicle for obtaining an education for life in a broad sense, so welcome to the great world of chemistry!

The one which is introduced or produced in its perfect form is called Sanskrit. The word Sanskrit is formed from “sam + krit” where (sam) prefix means (samyak) ‘entirely’ or ‘wholly’ or ‘perfectly,’ and krit means ‘done.’ Sanskrit was first introduced by Brahma to the Sage of the celestial abodes and it is still the language of the celestial abode,so it is also called the Dev Vani. Sanskrit is one of the official languages of India and is popularly known as a classical language of the country. It is considered as the mother of all languages. It is also one of the 22 official languages of India.

Sanskrit is the Mother of all languages. About 97% of world languages have been directly or indirectly influenced by this language. Sanskrit has the highest number of vocabularies than any other language in the world.

102arab 78crore & 50lakh words have been used till now in Sanskrit. If it will be used in computers & technology then more these number of words will be used in next 100 years.

 United States of America has a University dedicated to Sanskrit and the NASA too has a department in it to research on Sanskrit manuscripts.

In fact, NASA declared it to be the “only unambiguous spoken language on the planet” – and very suitable for computer comprehension.

There is a report by a NASA scientist that America is creating 6th and 7th generation super computers based on Sanskrit language. Project deadline is 2025 for 6th generation and 2034 for 7th generation computer. After this there will be a revolution all over the world to learn Sanskrit. There are reports that Russians, Germans and Americans are actively doing research on Hindu's sacred books and are producing them back to the world in their name. Seventeen countries around the world have a University or two to study Sanskrit to gain technological advantages. 

Today, there are a handful of Indian villages (Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh) where Sanskrit is still spoken as the main language. It is an official language of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. For example in the village of Mathur in Karnataka, more than 90% of the population knows Sanskrit.
